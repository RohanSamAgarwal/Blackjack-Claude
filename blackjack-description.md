# Blackjack — Built with Claude in ~3 Hours

This is a fully-featured browser-based blackjack game with a realistic casino table, animated cards and chips, sound effects, AI opponents, and even a built-in card counting tool. It runs entirely in your browser — no downloads, no installs.

## The Backstory

Back at Purdue, my final project for my C programming class was a text-based blackjack game. It took me nearly 4 weeks and well over 25 hours to build — no graphics, no animations, just text in a terminal. It was one of the hardest projects I'd tackled at the time.

Years later, I decided to revisit the idea, but this time with a twist: I'd use Claude, Anthropic's AI assistant, to help me build it. This was my first time using Claude to code anything. Over the course of about 3 hours of back-and-forth conversation, we went from nothing to a polished, visual blackjack game that's lightyears beyond what I built in college.

## What It Does

- Realistic semicircular casino table with felt texture and gold trim
- Animated card dealing, chip stacking, and result effects
- Sound effects for every action — cards, chips, wins, losses, shuffles
- 1–3 AI opponents with different play styles (beginner, basic strategy, aggressive)
- Full rule support: split, double down, insurance, surrender
- Built-in strategy advisor that tells you the optimal play
- Card counting panel with Hi-Lo running and true counts
- A dramatic shuffle animation when the deck runs low
- Configurable 1–4 deck shoe
- ...and a hidden easter egg for the lucky ones 🍀

## What Surprised Me

What took me almost a month in C took about 3 hours with Claude — and the end result has animated graphics, sound, AI players, and features I never would have attempted on my own. It's a pretty striking example of how AI tools are changing what's possible for a solo developer. I described what I wanted in plain English, iterated on the design visually, and Claude handled the implementation.
